# Price_Of_Anarchy
Course Project of EE6418 : Dynamic Games : Theory and Applications

This project deals with analysis of the concept of 'Price of Anarchy'(PoA) in game theory. In particular it deals with the application of PoA in  various types of routing networks. The presentation was done using Beamer(Latex).

# Definition
Price of Anarchy measures the degradation of a systemâ€™s efficiency due to selfish, non-cooperative behaviour of the players. It is a measure of the inefficiency of equilibria in a game. Mathematically it is the ratio between the worst possible equilibrium and the social optimum of the game.

In other words, PoA is high in situations where the players of the game are non-cooperative and hence default to the Nash Equilibrium of the game rather than the social optimum. The lack of coordination between them causes them to worse off, as a group and as individuals.
